# Gene Ontology Cluster Review

### Cluster 1
* tRNA Processing
    - [Gupta](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9198291/)
        - Involved in cell proliferation, signaling, stress response, which implicates roled in tumorigenesis and progression
        - Modifications are necessart for tRNA folding, stability and function
        - Additionally, tRNA methyltransferase <u>ALKBH8</u> may impact mRNA translation through catalyzing the hydroxylation of cm5U or mcm5U into chm5U or mchm5U, respectively, in tRNAGly (U*CC) (Fu et al., 2010). This function may be linked to cancer cell progression as ALKBH8 has been found to be upregulated in bladder cancer and increase ROS production in cancer cells (Fu et al., 2010).
        - Hypoxia causes oxidatives stress which activates tumor-activating cascades, which changes tRNA modification
            - Not clear connection between ALKBHB and cancer progression. ALK promotes proliferation in gastric cancer but aids in survival in pancreatic and lung cancer
        - tRNA modifications help prevent disease in healthy cells but changes in the rate of translation of cell cycle genes can disrupt cell cycle regulation and lead to tumorigenesis
